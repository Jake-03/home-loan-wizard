# Home Loan Design Wizard
### Project Requirements
#### Version 1.4

## Introduction

### Purpose

<details>

  <summary>The purpose of the Home Loan Wizard...</summary> is to generate leads for the appropriate parties in the real estate market.  It will gather information about prospective customers, including contact information, and route appropriately.

</details>

### Scope

<details>
  <summary>The scope of the project is to create...</summary> a gated form that will ask appropriate and applicable questions and then a back end that will send the lead to the designated parties.
</details>

## Description

### Interfaces

<details>
  <summary>An interface will need to be created...</summary> to communicate between the form and the lenders' own systems, with all the information provided by the customer as well as a tag indicating the department for whom the report is intended.
</details>

### Environment

<details>
  <summary>The form is a web application...</summary> that should also function completely in a mobile browser.  The latest versions (as of 10/5/17) of Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Safari will be supported.
</details>

### User Characteristics

<details>
  <summary>The typical user of this web form is expected...</summary> to be an individual without much tech savvy, so the user interface should be very simple.

  As for the user on the lenders' side, they will have lots of technical acumen, and the interface need only be developed to the standards they provided, sending the information they requested in the format provided.  They will take care of the rest.
</details>

## Requirements

### External Interfaces

  ```xml
